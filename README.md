## Sedat the Random Killer (dice version) 

Mr. Sedat and six students (1-Ahmet, 2-Nil, 3-Tansa, 4-Berk, 5-Kami, 6-Ceren) are having a conversation at a round table. Sedat is seated at the head of the table, and he's holding a gun. Each student has a number between 1 and 6. When the user rolls the dice, if the number rolled matches one of the students' numbers, Mr. Sedat will have the person face the gun.  (A metaphor for giving 50 homework in a week)

 “If you just reduce the time you spend in the toilet, you can easily complete them.” -Mr. Yalçın
